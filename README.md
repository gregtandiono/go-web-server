# Framework-less Go Web Server

This repo is inspired by this [post](https://medium.com/code-zen/why-i-don-t-use-go-web-frameworks-1087e1facfa4). Basically I'm going to create a full-fledged go web server without the use of any existing frameworks.


## What this server is going to do

- This server should be able to create a user
- This server should be able to fetch a list of users

## Bonus

- Write tests for each of the routes' responses

## Todos

**Priority**

- [ ] Create a User Model
- [ ] Create a User Controller
- [ ] Create a User route handler
